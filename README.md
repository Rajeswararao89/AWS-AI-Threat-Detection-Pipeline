# ðŸš¨ Real-Time Threat Detection & Automated Response on AWS

This project implements an **AI-powered security pipeline** on AWS that detects suspicious activities in real-time using **Amazon GuardDuty**, and automatically triggers alerts and responses with **Lambda, EventBridge, and SNS**.


## ðŸš€ Features
- âœ… Real-time threat detection using **Amazon GuardDuty**
- âœ… Automated response with **AWS Lambda**
- âœ… Real-time alerts via **Amazon SNS (Email/SMS)**
- âœ… Event-driven integration with **Amazon EventBridge**
- âœ… Tested with simulated attacks (Trojan, Port Scan, Unauthorized Access)

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- **Amazon CloudTrail** â†’ Collects API activity logs  
- **Amazon GuardDuty** â†’ AI-based anomaly & threat detection  
- **Amazon EventBridge** â†’ Triggers automated responses  
- **AWS Lambda (Python)** â†’ Parses findings, generates alerts  
- **Amazon SNS** â†’ Sends security alerts in real-time  

## ðŸ“¸ Screenshots

## ðŸ§ª Testing
- Generate a sample GuardDuty finding:

aws guardduty create-sample-findings \
--detector-id YOUR_DETECTOR_ID \
--finding-types "Trojan:EC2/BlackholeTraffic"

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Outcomes
- Hands-on experience with AWS security services (GuardDuty, CloudTrail, EventBridge, SNS, Lambda).
- Designed and deployed an event-driven architecture for real-time threat detection.
- Built serverless automation with AWS Lambda and Python.
- Strengthened understanding of cloud security automation & AI-powered anomaly detection.
- Practiced incident response workflows with automated alerting and remediation.
- Gained experience integrating multiple AWS services into a cohesive solution.
- Enhanced troubleshooting by simulating attacks and validating responses.
